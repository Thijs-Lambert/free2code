## Welcome to _CSS Diner_!

CSS Diner is a fun little "game" that teaches you the basics of **CSS selectors**.
We know that understanding the way CSS selectors work can be confusing at first, but once you spend a bit more time on the topic, it will become straightforward!

In this game, you will see a _fancy little table_ that will serve you a plate with or without food. Your job is to select the requested items shown in a short paragraph on the top of your screen.

Use the editor and the HTML viewer to find the correct CSS selector.

Can you reach level 32?

Good luck!
